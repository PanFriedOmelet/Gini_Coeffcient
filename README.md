# Gini Coefficient
The Gini coefficient is a machine learning matrix. It tells how well the model can distinguish between high values and low values.
Note that the Gini coefficient in this place is not the Gini index which is used to measure the probability of a particular variable being wrongly classified. However, sometimes the Gini coefficient refers to the Gini index.


I was first introduced to use the Gini coefficient when I was doing a project as a graduate student and I think that it is interesting to share. Please feel free to copy or adjust the code if you want to.
